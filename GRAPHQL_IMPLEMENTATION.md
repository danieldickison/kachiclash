# GraphQL API Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of a read-only GraphQL API for the Kachiclash sumo prediction game.

## Overview

The GraphQL API provides comprehensive access to all game data including players, tournaments (bashos), scores, picks, and wrestler information. It's designed to be read-only to maintain data integrity while enabling external applications, dashboards, and analytics tools.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **async-graphql**: Modern Rust GraphQL library with strong type safety
- **async-graphql-actix-web**: Integration with the existing Actix-web server
- **SQLite**: Existing database backend (unchanged)
- **Chrono**: DateTime support for GraphQL schemas

### Code Structure
```
src/
├── graphql/
│   ├── mod.rs          # Module exports
│   ├── schema.rs       # Query resolvers and schema definition
│   └── types.rs        # GraphQL type definitions
└── handlers/
    └── graphql.rs      # HTTP handlers for GraphQL endpoint
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. GraphQL Schema Design

**Core Types:**
- `Player`: Player information with rankings and achievements
- `Basho`: Tournament data with participation statistics
- `Rikishi`: Wrestler information with performance records
- `PlayerScore`: Player performance in specific tournaments
- `Award`: Tournament awards and achievements
- `LeaderboardEntry`: Current standings and rankings

**Input Types:**
- `BashoFilter`: Filtering options for tournament queries
- `PlayerFilter`: Filtering options for player queries

### 2. Query Resolvers

The API exposes these main query endpoints:

#### Player Queries
- `players(filter: PlayerFilter)`: Get all players with optional filtering
- `player(id: Int!)`: Get specific player by ID
- `playerByName(name: String!)`: Find player by name

#### Tournament Queries
- `bashos(filter: BashoFilter)`: Get all tournaments with optional filtering
- `basho(id: String!)`: Get specific tournament by ID
- `bashoRikishi(bashoId: String!)`: Get wrestlers for a tournament

#### Score & Performance Queries
- `playerScores(bashoId: String!, playerId: Int)`: Get performance data
- `leaderboard(bashoId: String)`: Get current or historical rankings

### 3. Type Safety & Error Handling

**GraphQL-Compatible Types:**
- Custom types (BashoId, Rank) converted to strings for GraphQL compatibility
- DateTime types supported through async-graphql chrono feature
- Option types handled gracefully with nullable GraphQL fields

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid basho ID format validation
- Player/tournament not found scenarios
- Database connection error propagation
- Standard GraphQL error format

### 4. Data Conversion Layer

**From Internal Types to GraphQL:**
- `crate::data::Player` → `graphql::types::Player`
- `crate::data::BashoInfo` → `graphql::types::Basho`
- `crate::data::BashoRikishi` → `graphql::types::Rikishi`
- Custom rank and ID types → String representations

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient database queries using existing data layer
- Minimal data copying with strategic cloning
- Reuse of existing connection pooling

## Integration Points

### 1. Server Integration
- New `/api/graphql` endpoint for GraphQL queries
- GraphQL Playground available at same endpoint (GET requests)
- Integrated with existing Actix-web middleware stack

### 2. Database Layer
- Leverages existing database connection pool (`DbConn`)
- Reuses all existing data access methods
- No changes to database schema required

### 3. Authentication
- Currently read-only, no authentication required
- Future enhancement: could integrate with existing session system

## API Features

### Query Capabilities
- **Flexible Filtering**: Filter players and bashos by various criteria
- **Nested Queries**: Access related data in single requests
- **Pagination**: Limit results to prevent large responses
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors

### Data Access
- **Historical Data**: Access all past tournament results
- **Real-time Data**: Current leaderboards and ongoing tournaments
- **Player Profiles**: Complete player statistics and history
- **Tournament Details**: Full tournament information and participants

## Documentation & Examples

### 1. API Documentation (`GRAPHQL_API.md`)
- Complete schema documentation
- Example queries for common use cases
- Input type specifications
- Error handling examples

### 2. Interactive Demo (`examples/graphql_demo.html`)
- Browser-based GraphQL client
- Pre-built queries for testing
- Real-time result display
- Configurable endpoint

### 3. Programmatic Client (`examples/graphql_client.js`)
- Node.js example client
- Demonstrates all major query types
- Error handling patterns
- Statistics aggregation examples

## Testing & Validation

### Compilation Verification
- ✅ Compiles successfully with `cargo build`
- ✅ All GraphQL types properly implemented
- ✅ No runtime type errors in schema generation
- ✅ Integration with existing server architecture

### Schema Validation
- ✅ All queries return expected data structures
- ✅ Input validation for basho IDs and parameters
- ✅ Proper error messages for invalid requests
- ✅ GraphQL playground functionality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Player Query
```graphql
query {
  players(filter: { hasEmperorsCup: true, limit: 5 }) {
    name
    emperorsCups
    joinDate
  }
}
```

### Tournament Results
```graphql
query($bashoId: String!) {
  playerScores(bashoId: $bashoId) {
    player { name }
    wins
    place
    awards { name }
  }
}
```

### Current Leaderboard
```graphql
query {
  leaderboard {
    rank
    score
    player {
      name
      emperorsCups
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates during tournaments
- **Mutations**: Admin operations (with authentication)
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated query options
- **Caching**: Redis integration for improved performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Analytics**: Query performance monitoring

### API Versioning
- Schema introspection available
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Deprecation strategy for field changes

## Deployment Considerations

### Development
- GraphQL Playground enabled for testing
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Hot reload compatible with existing setup

### Production
- Playground can be disabled via configuration
- Error messages sanitized for security
- Performance monitoring recommended
- CORS configuration may be needed for external clients

## Conclusion

The GraphQL API implementation successfully provides comprehensive read-only access to all Kachiclash game data while maintaining the existing application architecture. The type-safe approach ensures reliability, while the flexible query system enables powerful client applications and analytics tools.

Key achievements:
- ✅ Complete GraphQL schema covering all major data types
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing Rust/Actix-web application
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples
- ✅ Type-safe implementation with error handling
